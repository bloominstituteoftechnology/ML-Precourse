Why Do I Want to Learn Machine Learning?

What is exciting? The combination of big data providing advanced analytics in ML specific to image recognition, model accuracy, speech to text and translations.
	Closing the gap for the world. Language and distance shouldn't be boundaries for us to improve as humans.
	
What are the best job opportunities? I would reiterate what I said above. Speech recognition should be huge (Google, for instance). The best job opportunities 
	are likely in advertising, visual processing, search engine. I'd rather see something in prediction capabilities (ex: Wharton working with City PD to improve 
	city development ideas by aggregating data for crime, traffic, pedestrian activity). AI / ML should continue to improve and be exciting.
	
What to do to make self more employable in ML? ACTIONABLE and PRESENTABLE projects. Improving portfolio, making public the web-scraping/ML/NLP that I have done.
	Projects in both R and Python with modeling. More fun insight to Kaggle (fun being subjects I'm interested in).
	
What dangers are there in ML? Gathering data, cleaning data, analyzing data and demonstrating insights on the data are the required steps. We can argue 2 steps 
	are dangerous. Gathering data and making/acting on the insights cause problems. Gathering have legality, privacy and security problems, potentially. How much 
	do people care about their data being collected if it's making everything around them personalized? To each individual, there's a boundary. Cell phones, for 
	instance, likely have the most accurate, detailed geo-locating data in the world. Whether or not cell providers would ever share/act more on this? Time will 
	tell. For insights - overfitting data can be a problem in the wrong hands. Or invasion of privacy or security. There are plenty of questions here. There have 
	already been fights/misunderstanding over actuarial tables in insurance over predicting "life-value" that become more accurate with details on personal lives. 
	Smoking, weight, family history, diet, etc... all factor in. Makes for a 'better' picture, but people often won't like results if it means they pay more. 
	Additionally, TRUST is a danger. People didn't trust cars when the Model T came out. People didn't believe in what the internet could be. Didn't trust it. And 
	we've seen many instances in between. AI / ML and what technology provides can make rational decisions (in certain increasing cases) moreso than what humans 
	can do - creatures of emotion vs creatures of logic, as much as we'd like to believe the latter.
Moral and ethical considerations are included above ^. Similar there. Data security, privatization - what do we want to give up for more convenience. People should 
	be very mindful of terms of services. Think: VPN (idea is to privatize network data... but the companies often sell data or give up your data anyway upon request).
